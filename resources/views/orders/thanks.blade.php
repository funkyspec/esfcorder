        <h3>Thanks for ordering!</h3>
        <p>We will be in touch by email later this week with your final order and pricing. Occasionally nature intervenes in our plans, and unforeseen circumstances prevent harvest of some items we thought would be available earlier in the week. We let you know in a follow-up email if this happens and any changes to your pricing.</p>
        <p>Any questions or concerns, please email us: <!-- need js email address here --></p>
