        <h3>Thanks for ordering!</h3>
        <p>We will be in touch by email later this week with your final order and pricing. Occasionally nature intervenes in our plans, and unforeseen circumstances prevent harvest of some items we thought would be available earlier in the week. If this happens, we'll adjust your price accordingly.</p>
        <p>Any questions, concerns or to update or cancel your order, please email us: <span class="emmyadd"></span></p>
